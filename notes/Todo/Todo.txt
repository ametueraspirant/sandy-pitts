add sliding to move/collide function.

look into function chaining for timers using return self or something like that.

add gear stats and gear stat swapping.

do some sequence bullshit so weapon swooshes are anchored to the world and not the player.

add player/gear bounce.

fix animation cancelling causing random breaks but only sometimes.

bugs manifest as either weapon locks in rotation and refuses to attack again, or _box suddenly becomes instance id -4 "noone"
