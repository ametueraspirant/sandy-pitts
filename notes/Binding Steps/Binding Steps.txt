binding steps:
- main menu -
all players will be bound ascending from 1 in the order they press the bind key.
if a player presses the key again, they will be unbound, but slots will be conserved for players already bound.
randomly choose player to be villain or allow players to choose.

- transition: start game -
spawn players up to the number of players connected, with each to their own individual control.
if a player disconnects, keep players in the same slots and show an opening for the disconnected player's slot.
anyone who joins or connects at the time will be added to the lowest slow available.

- menu: rebind all players -
menu button that will pause the game and allow rebinding of controllers.
villain slot will be preserved to whoever loads in.
warn if villain slot is not filled it will be reassigned randomly.

- ingame: characters -
if a player disconnects, the character will wait around until reconnected. If the character dies before the player is reconnected, they will connect as a ghost.
new connections will always connect as a ghost.
living players can sacrifice some hp or something to revive dead players.

- perhaps -
waiting time after player disconnection to kill the character automatically.
if players come out of rebinding all controllers with a missing slot, kill that character.
- again, perhaps -
